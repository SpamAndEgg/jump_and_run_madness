# Jump and Run Madness

This is a very basic Super Mario like jump and run game with only one level programmed in Python 3. A convolution function can give out each frame of the game covoluted by a kernel. This convolution output can be used to feed a neural network. With further work, a neural network could learn how to play this game.

## Play the game
To start the game, just run the main.py.

## Screenshots
